Exercise 2:
List main differences between primitive data type int and class Integer. Be as specific as possible.
What are advantages of using each one?
List all specific functionalities that are available when using one and not the other.
Consult Java API as a resource to find out this information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A Java both int and Integer are used to store integer type data.
The major difference between both is type of int is primitive while Integer is of class type.
+ A int is a data type that stores 32 bit signed two's compliment integer.
+ On other hand Integer is a wrapper class which wraps a primitive type int into an object.

- Advantages:

+ primitive data type int:
    - helps in storing integer value into memory.
    - Lesser memory allocation: takes 32 bits(4 bytes) to store (Integer is an object which takes 128 bits (16 bytes) to store its int value.)

+ class Integer:
    -  helps in converting int into object and to convert an object into int as per requirement.
    -   Flexibility: is more flexible in storing and manipulating an int data.
    Since Wrapper classes inherit Object class, they can be used in collections with Object reference or generics.
    (int only allows binary value of an integer in it.)
    -	Casting: we can assign string to an object of Integer type using the Integer(String) constructor
    or by even use parseInt(String) to convert a String literal to an int value.
    -   Direct Conversion to Other base.: we can directly convert its integer value to other bases such as Binary,
    Octal or Hexadecimal format using toBinaryString(), toOctalString() or toHexString() respectively.
    -   Allowed operations: can reverse number or rotate it left or right using reverse(), rotateLeft() and rotateRight() respectively.
